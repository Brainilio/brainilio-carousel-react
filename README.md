# Description

This is not my best and perfect work, but I believe it showcases what I can do. I have not used a tutorial to make this, as I believed
it to be extra challenging to be able to see how I would approach these kinds of problems without any resources. Maybe that was a mistake
to do that in the middle of an interview, but the work is done! However, I can promise you I can do way better than this, haha. Anyways:
I developed two carousels, one that accepts elements as children and allows you to slide with your finger; and another one that
has indicators and has an infinite scroll (only when you reach the end though). I decided to do this to showcase how you can approach
this type of problem in different ways.
